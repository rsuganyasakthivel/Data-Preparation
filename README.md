# DataPreparation
Data Preparation is a crucial part in Data Science Project Life Cycle. It includes:
1. Data cleaning
2. Data integration 
3. Data transformation
4. Data reduction 
5. Data discretization.

This Project has a sample program explaining 
1. How could we prepare the data which is unstructured. Instead of doing it manually, how we could do it with pandas.
2. Simple data analysis, preprocessing, model training and prediction have also been done for making it a complete project.
